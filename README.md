This series of tutorials was developed for the <a href="https://heliopython.org/summer-school-24">2024 
Python in Heliophysics Summer School</a> held May 20-24, 2024.  They have been adapted for use as a self-guided learning course.

##  Use and Dependencies
These materials were developed for the summer school students, but are intended to function as stand-alone lessons freely to be used by anyone.  

The lessons use the following packages:  numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and tensorflow (keras).  

##  Acknowledgments
